- Second time 
  Divide Two Integers:
  abs(INT_MIN) will not return INT_MAX

  Decode Ways:
  DP

  String to Integer:
  Take care of INT_MIN, INT_MAX.

  Surrounded Regions: 
  Starting from the boundary.

  Reverse Words in a sring: 
  String tokenizer.

  Max Points on a Line:
  Overlapping points.
  
  3Sum:
  From two sides to the middle.

Sep 20&21:
  Longest Palindrome Substring: 
  cannot AC using DP.

  Merge sort linkedlist:
  the key is hwo to deal with the root situation: len == 1. return a singleton.

Sep 22&&23
  First Positive Number: 
  Important.

  Permutation Sequance: 
  Need to take another look.

  Unsolve Sudoku solver. Valid Sudoku. Need to do iteration solution for 
  inorder tree, pre order and post order.

  Longest Consecutive Sequence:
  I did it using set to sort the array. If sorting using insert of set, can
  it reaches O(1) complexity?  Need to take another look at optimized 
  solution.

  Skip spiral matrix
  
  Take one more look into search into rotated sorted array ii
