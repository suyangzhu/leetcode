- Second time 
  Divide Two Integers:
  abs(INT_MIN) will not return INT_MAX

  Decode Ways:
  DP

  String to Integer:
  Take care of INT_MIN, INT_MAX.

  Surrounded Regions: 
  Starting from the boundary.

  Reverse Words in a sring: 
  String tokenizer.

  Max Points on a Line:
  Overlapping points.
  
  3Sum:
  From two sides to the middle.

Sep 20&21:
  Longest Palindrome Substring: 
  cannot AC using DP.

  Merge sort linkedlist:
  the key is hwo to deal with the root situation: len == 1. return a singleton.

Sep 22&&23
  First Positive Number: 
  Important.

  Permutation Sequance: 
  Need to take another look.
Sep 24
  Unsolve N-queens, Pow(x), sqrt(x)

  Unsolve Sudoku solver. Valid Sudoku. Need to do iteration solution for 
  inorder tree, pre order and post order.

  Longest Consecutive Sequence:
  I did it using set to sort the array. If sorting using insert of set, can
  it reaches O(1) complexity?  Need to take another look at optimized 
  solution.

  Skip spiral matrix
  
  Take one more look into search into rotated sorted array ii 

Oct 2nd.
  Palindrome Partitioning II second time take referrence to answer.
  Skip:: Candy, Spiral Matrix, Sudoku Solver.

  To check if the word exists on a chess, we need to maintain a visited
  map to avoid circles. Besides we need to check if x, y is on the chess
  before we compare word[idx] and board[x][y]

  Regular expression. Need to understand the recursion solution.

  Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum, the init value should set to INT_MIN.
  The current maxsum through root may not be the largest one. so do not 
  pick it without comparison.

  MultiplyTwo Strings: take care of carries every cycle of computation.

  How to merge sort a linked list. ** head !!

  Insert Intervals ---> Merge Interval (keep inserting next to the
		        already-sorted interval serial)
  Merge Intervals---> Insert Interval (Put the insertion at the end, then
		        sort the whole serial.)

  Longest Palindrome substring in string: Manacher's algorithm.

  WordBreak: DFS solution vs DP solution.

  Laregest Histogram Area: Take care of the priority of a?b:c; must apply
  parenthese in some situation.

  4 sum: base on 3 sum; however must check duplication.

  StrStr the end of string should be '\0' , not '0'. To be same, use 
  !*ptr instead of *ptr == '\0'

  RecoverBinarySearchTree: need to think about constant space.

  ZigZag skipped it once more^_^

  Distinct Subsequence: pay attention to the first row of matrix and the 
  coordinate. we should cmp T[i-1] && S[j-1] since the index starts from
  0.

  Permutation II: How to filter duplicates. Sort first. If element i == 
  element i-1 and element i-1 has not been visited before. Do not use 
  element i. 

  N-Queens and Pow skipped. Palindrome Partitioning need to take a second 
  look at.

  Partition List: need to take a second look at other's solution.


  SubsetII How to skipped the duplicates.

  Valid Suduko: it is 123456789, NOT 012345678
